            <h2>& How it's Affecting Our Food</h2>

        <p class="hometext" id="p1">
          Our food supply is much more affected by climate change than you probably thought. Even though global warming may seem to be slight at a 1-2° Fahrenheit change since 1880, the effect is disproportionate, and a tiny change can still snowball into catastrophic changes in our environment. These kinds of changes can be enough to disrupt the production of food. Grains are hit by extreme heat and drought in countries that they’re grown in. Soybeans and rice also are threatened. Other weather patterns can be dangerous too, such as unusually heavy rains causing locust outbreaks in Northeastern Africa, eating many of the crops that would be eaten by humans. Wildfires caused by excessive heat and hurricanes and storms caused by warming oceans will also cause crop destruction.
        </p>
        <p class="hometext" id="p2">
          If that wasn’t bad enough, the decline in food production isn’t even — in fact the nations hit the hardest will be poorer, third-world countries. This could also create even more conflict, because the amount of fertile land on Earth will dwindle. The increased scarcity of food will lead to increased prices, making it harder for low-income people to afford food. Extreme food shortages and other weather disasters will cause many people of poorer countries to migrate, searching for food security, complicating immigration politics. Because most countries trade for food from other countries, climate change poses an enormous threat to the food security of people all around the world.

          So the question is: Is there anything we can do? And if so, <i>what</i> can we do? Well, while we probably won’t be able to completely reverse the effects of climate change, there are  many things we can do to better the problem at hand. A huge way to fix the problem actually involves the people directly affected by it. Over a third of greenhouse gas emissions in our atmosphere comes from improper soil management, releasing the carbon in the soil. Livestock also contribute significantly to global warming by farting, releasing methane into the atmosphere. If farmers around the world could change the way they grow their products, it would make a massive difference in stopping climate change.
        </p>
        <p class="hometext" id="p3">
          One way that farmers could change this would be to plant cover crops, which are unobstructing, contained crops to plant in between rows of smaller crops like vegetables. This limits the amount of exposed dirt, and therefore limits the amount of carbon released. Another preventative measure would be what’s known as agroforestry. It’s fairly well known that trees trap carbon in the atmosphere, so what would be a better idea than planting trees on farms? It also prevents soil erosion and supports animal life. A way that this could be implemented could be a legal mandate to have a row of cover crop between every row of plants, or a minimum amount of trees on a given property of farmland. The time to act is now, because if we wait any longer, climate change may get too far out of our control to stop.
